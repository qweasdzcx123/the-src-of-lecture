Abstract—The large-system decoupling property of a MAP estimator is studied when it estimates the i.i.d. vector x from the observation y = Ax + z with A being chosen from a wide range of matrix ensembles, and the noise vector z being i.i.d. and Gaussian. Using the replica method, we show that the marginal joint distribution of any two corresponding input and output symbols converges to a deterministic distribution which describes the input-output distribution of a single user system followed by a MAP estimator. Under the bRSB assumption, the single user system is a scalar channel with additive noise where the noise term is given by the sum of an independent Gaussian random variable and b correlated interference terms. As the bRSB assumption reduces to RS, the interference terms vanish which results in the formerly studied RS decoupling principle.

I. INTRODUCTION

A linear vector system with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is described by

y = Ax + z

(1)

where the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) source vector xn×1, taken from support n, is measured by the ran-
dom system matrix Ak×n and corrupted by an i.i.d. Gaussian
noise vector zk×1. The observation vector y is given to the vector estimator g(·) which maps the k-dimensional vector y to an n-dimensional vector xˆn×1 ∈ n. The entries of xˆ are in general correlated due to the coupling imposed by A
and g(·). Considering the entries xj and xˆj, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, the marginal joint distribution of (xˆj , xj) in the large-system limit, i.e. k, n ↑ ∞, is of interest. To clarify the point, consider the linear estimation, i.e. g(y) = GTy for some Gk×n, and denote A = [a1 · · · an] and G = [g1 · · · gn] with ai and gi being k × 1 vectors for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Thus,

One considers the right hand side (r.h.s.) of (2) as the linear estimation of a single user system with additive impairment in which the impairment term is not necessarily Gaussian and the system is indexed by j. For some families of A and G, it is shown that the index dependency of these systems vanishes and the impairment term converges to a Gaussian noise term with modiﬁed power level when the system dimensions tend to inﬁnity, e.g. [1]. Thus, one can assume the linear vector estimator in the large-system limit to decouple into a bank of single user linear estimators operating over n parallel scalar systems with additive Gaussian noise terms. This decoupling

property of the linear estimators is rigorously justiﬁed invoking the central limit theorem and the properties of large random matrices. For nonlinear forms of g(·), however, the analysis faces difﬁculties, since the output entries do not linearly decouple. Tanaka noted the similarity between the asymptotic analysis of spin glasses [2] and vector estimators and showed that the performance of a vector estimator in the large-system limit can be represented as the macroscopic parameter of a spin glass [3]. Consequently, a class of generally nonlinear estimators was analyzed using the nonrigorous replica method developed in statistical mechanics. Inspired by [3], several works employed the replica method to study the performance of nonlinear estimators in the asymptotic regime considering different classes of estimators, system matrices, and performance measures, e.g. [4]. Having the decoupling property of the linear estimators in mind, it was conjectured that this property holds for nonlinear estimators as well. In [5], Guo and Verdú justiﬁed this conjecture for the postulated Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator

g(y) = E{x|y, A}

(3)

where A is considered to be i.i.d., and the expectation is taken over x due to some postulated posterior distribution qx|y,A. For this setup, the authors showed the Replica Symmetry (RS) decoupling principle which says that under the RS assumption the marginal joint distribution of (xj, xˆj ) converges to the input-output joint distribution of a scalar channel with additive Gaussian noise followed by a single user MMSE estimator. The RS decoupling principle was further extended to the case with a postulated Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) estimator in [6] where Rangan et al. studied

g(y) = arg min

(4)

Ê Ê for some “utility function” u(·) : n → + and non-negative

real “estimation parameter” λ. Except for the cases with an

i.i.d. system matrix, the decoupling property of nonlinear

estimators for a larger class of matrix ensembles has not

yet been addressed precisely. In [7], the authors investigated

this issue partially by studying the support recovery of sparse

Gaussian sources. They considered the case of a source vector

which is ﬁrst randomly measured by a squared matrix, and

then, the measurements are sparsely sampled by an i.i.d. binary

vector. Employing a MAP estimator for recovering, the RS

decoupling principle was justiﬁed for the case in which the

measuring matrix belongs to a large set of matrix ensembles.

Although the class of matrices is broadened in [7], the result

cannot be considered as a complete generalization of [5] and

[6], since it is restricted to cases with a sparse Gaussian source and kn−1 ≤ 1. Another issue not investigated in the literature is the marginal joint distribution under the Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) assumption. In fact, the previous studies investigated the decoupling principle considering the RS ansatz; however, despite the RS validity in some particular cases, there are still several cases requiring further RSB investigations, e.g. [8], [9].
In this paper, we address both the issues and broaden the scope of the decoupling principle stated in [6] to both a larger set of matrix ensembles, and the RSB ansätze. More precisely, we justify the decoupling property of the postulated MAP estimator when
1) A is chosen from a large family of random matrices, 2) kn−1 takes any non-negative real number, and 3) the RS and RSB ansätze are considered.
For this setup, we show that under all replica ansätze, the joint distribution of (xj , xˆj) in the large-system limit converges to the input-output distribution of a scalar system in which the source symbol is corrupted by effective noise and estimated by a single user MAP estimator. We determine the effective noise term and estimation parameter under the RSB assumption with b steps of breaking (bRSB), and show that the noise term under this assumption is given by the sum of an independent Gaussian random variable and b correlated terms. By reducing the assumption to RS, the correlated terms vanish, and the noise term becomes Gaussian. Thus, one can consider the decoupling principle of [6] to be a special case of the more general decoupling principle illustrated here.

We denote the expectation over x by Ex, and an expectation over all random variables involved in a given expression by E.

Whenever needed, we consider the entries of x to be discrete random variables; the results of this paper, however, are in full generality and directly extend to continuous distributions.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

Let the system in (1) satisfy the following constraints.

(a) The number of observations k is a deterministic sequence of n such that

lim
n↑∞

k n

=

1 r

<

∞.

(6)

(b) xn×1 is an i.i.d. random vector with each element being
Ê distributed due to px over in which ⊆ . Ê (c) Ak×n is randomly generated over k×n ⊆ k×n, such
that J = ATA has the eigendecomposition

J = UDUT

(7)

where U is an orthogonal Haar distributed matrix and
D is a diagonal matrix with the empirical eigenvalue distribution (density of states) converging as n ↑ ∞ to a deterministic distribution FJ. (d) zk×1 is a real i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian random vector with variance λ0, i.e., z ∼ N (0, λ0Ik). (e) x, A, and z are independent.

In order to estimate the source vector, the postulated MAP esti-

mator as deﬁned in (4) is employed. The estimators postulates

a non-negative estimation parameter λ and a non-negative util-

ity function u(·) which decouples, i.e., u(x) =

n i=1

u(xi

).

Deﬁning the estimated vector xˆ := g(y), the conditional

distribution of xˆj given xj for some j ∈ [1 : n] is denoted by
pxjˆ(|nx). Thus, the marginal joint distribution of xj and xˆj at the mass point (vˆ, v) is written as

pxˆj,xj (vˆ, v) = px(v)pxjˆ(|nx)(vˆ|v).

(8)

Considering the large-system limit, we deﬁne the asymptotic conditional distribution of xˆj given xj at (vˆ, v) as

pjxˆ|x(vˆ|v)

:=

lim
n↑∞

pxjˆ(|nx) (vˆ|v ).

(9)

We also suppose the self averaging assumption which says
(f) Given A of the form (7) with FJ, the limit in (9) exists and is almost surely constant in realizations of A.

III. GENERAL DECOUPLING PRINCIPLE
The main contribution of this study is to extend the scope of the decoupling principle. To illustrate the result, consider the following single user system: the input x is passed through the channel y = x + z where z ∼ pz|x for the given input x. The observation y is then given to a single user MAP estimator with the same utility function as for the vector estimator deﬁned in Section II, i.e. u(·), and an estimation parameter denoted by λs. Indicating the conditional distribution of the estimator’s output xˆ for the given input x by pxˆ|x, our general decoupling principle says that under a set of assumptions (a) the asymptotic conditional distribution pjxˆ|x is indepen-
dent of the index j, and we have pjxˆ|x = pxˆ|x. (b) pz|x and λs are determined in terms of λ, λ0 and the
statistics of x and A.
The set of assumptions which yields the validity of the above statements are enforced within the large-system analysis. In the following, we brieﬂy illustrate our approach and determine the parameters of the single user system.

IV. DERIVATION OF GENERAL DECOUPLING PRINCIPLE
Before illustrating our derivation approach, let us deﬁne the R-transform. For a random variable t, the Stieltjes transform

over the upper half complex plane is deﬁned as Gt(s) = E [t− s]−1. Denoting the inverse with respect to (w.r.t.) composition with G−t 1(·), the R-transform is Rt(ω) = G−t 1(ω) − ω−1 such that limω↓0 Rt(ω) = E t. The deﬁnition also extends
to matrix arguments. Assuming a matrix Mn×n to have the eigendecomposition M = U diag[λ1, . . . , λn] U−1, Rt(M) is then deﬁned as Rt(M) = U diag[Rt(λ1), . . . , Rt(λn)] U−1.

The derivation of the general decoupling principle is based

on the moment method. To clarify the approach, consider the

non-negative integers k and ℓ, and deﬁne the joint moment Mjk(,nℓ ) = E xˆkj xℓj , for j ∈ [1 : n]. After evaluating the limit of Mjk(,nℓ ) as n ↑ ∞, we show that for all k and ℓ the asymptotic
joint moment is equivalent to the corresponding joint moment

of the single user system. Consequently, using the uniqueness

of the mapping from the set of integer moments’ sequences

to the set of measures, under a set of conditions investigated

in the classical moment problem [10], we conclude that both

couples (xˆj , xj) and (xˆ, x) have a same distribution. We start with evaluating the limit of Mjk(,nℓ ). The evaluation is based on
the nonrigorous method of replicas developed in the theory

of spin glasses [2], and accepted as a mathematical tool in

information theory. To do so, deﬁne the “weighted average
joint moment” over the index set Ï ⊂ [1 : n] as

Ï Ï Mk,ℓ(n)(xˆ; x) := E | 1 |

xˆkw xℓw .

Ï w∈

Ï Setting = [j : j + nη] for some η ∈ (0, 1], the asymptotic

joint moment of jth entry can be written as

Mjk(,nℓ )

(11)

Thus, the evaluation of the asymptotic moment reduces to

taking the limits in the r.h.s. of (11) which needs the weighted

average joint moment in (10) to be explicitly calculated for an

arbitrary integer n. Alternatively, we can deﬁne the function

Z(β, h) =

(13)

The logarithmic expectation in the r.h.s. of (13) is not a trivial

task to do, and therefore, one bypasses the direct evaluation

using the Riesz equality which for any random variable t states E log t = limm↓0 m−1 log E tm. Thus, regarding (11) and (13)

Ï for = [j : j + nη]. In (14), we face two major difﬁculties:
1) evaluating the real moments i.e., E [Z(β, h)]m, and 2) tak-

ing the limits in the order stated. Basic analytical methods

fail to address these challenges properly, and therefore, we

invoke the nonrigorous method of replicas. The replica method

suggests to evaluate the moment for an arbitrary integer m as

an analytic function in m; then, assume that 1) the “replica

continuity” holds which means that the function analytically continues from the set of integers to the real axis (or at least a vicinity of zero), and 2) the limits are exchangeable. Following the above prescription, we consider the ﬁrst assumption and ﬁnd E [Z(β, h)]m which for an integer m reduces to

In order to evaluate (15), one can initially take the expectation over z and A. Due to the lack of space, we leave the details for
the extended version of the manuscript; however, we brieﬂy
explain the strategy. After taking the expectations, and deﬁning the m × m “replica correlation matrix” Q such that [Q]ab = n−1(x − va)T(x − vb), (15) is given in terms of Q as

E [Z(β, h)]m = Ex e−nG(TQ)enI(Q)dQ

where Tr{·} denotes the trace, RJ(·) is the R-transform w.r.t. FJ, and ǫn tends to zero as n ↑ ∞. Here, one can employ the

Laplace method of integration and replace the r.h.s. of (16)

in the large-system limit with the integrand at its saddle point

multiplied by some bounded coefﬁcient Kn; thus, as n ↑ ∞

E [Z(β, h)]m =. Kne−n[G(TQ˜ )−I(Q˜ )]

E (Q˜ , x, v; β) = e−β(x−v)TTRJ(−2βTQ˜ )(x−v)−βu(v). (20)

Here, one needs to ﬁnd the saddle point which is not a feasible task in general. The strategy for pursuing the analysis is to restrict the saddle point, i.e. Q˜ , to be of a special form, and ﬁnd the solution within the restricted set of matrices. This is where an additional assumption such as the RS or RSB assumption arises. It is clear that these restrictions do not lead us to the correct solution in general, and therefore, one needs to widen the set of replica correlation matrices to ﬁnd a more accurate solution. In the sequel, we consider different structures on the correlation matrix and ﬁnd the replica ansatz under those assumptions. However, considering (19), it is observed that “regardless of the structure” on Q˜ , the joint moment Mjk,ℓ is independent of the index j even before taking the limit η ↓ 0. Therefore, employing the moment method, we conclude

and the limits in (14) to exist and exchange. Then pjxˆ|x, as deﬁned in (9), does not depend on the index j.

Proposition 1 states a more general form of the decoupling

principle studied in previous works. In fact, the only assump-

tions which need to be satisﬁed are the replica continuity and the exchange of limits; and, no structure of the correlation matrix is imposed. However, the decoupled scalar system does depend on the structure imposed on Q˜ . To ﬁnd the decoupled single user system, we start with the most primary structure which is imposed by considering the RS assumption.

distribution of xˆ given x in Figure 1 where gmap[(·); λs, u] is

a single user MAP deﬁned in (23), and pz|x(z|x) = π(z).

The results in the literature have always considered the RS

ansatz, and can be recovered as special cases of Proposition 2. E.g., results of [6] are derived by setting RJ(ω) = (1 − rω)−1.
The RS ansatz, however, does not provide a valid solution,

in general. Parisi in [11] introduced the RSB scheme which

widens the restricted set of saddle point matrices recursively. To illustrate the RSB scheme, let Qb be a basic structure for

the replica correlation matrix; moreover, assume m to be a

multiple of an integer ξ. Then, the correlation matrix can be grouped as a ξ × ξ matrix of blocks with each block being an

the off-diagonal blocks to be κ1 m for some κ. In fact, the new ξ
set of correlation matrices is constructed by imposing the RS
structure block-wisely using Qb and κ1 m as basic blocks. The ξ
RSB scheme can be recursively iterated: one can set the basic
structure Qb and ﬁnd the new structure Qb1; then, by taking Qb1 as the new basic structure, a wider set of correlation matrices
is found. Parisi considers Qb to have the RS structure.

Here, the decoupled system differs from the system obtained under the RS ansatz within one additive tap which is intuitively approximating the interference caused by the coupling. In fact, the RS ansatz assumes the coupling caused by the system matrix and vector estimator to vanish as the system tends to its large limits; however, the 1RSB solution takes the coupling into account and approximates it with one tap of interference. This approximation may become more accurate, if we let the correlation matrix to be chosen from a larger set of matrices. bRSB Assumption: Iterating the RSB scheme with b steps,

of λs, {λsν }bν=0 and {Λν }bν=1 for the extended version.

Proposition 4 Let the assumptions in Proposition 1, and

the bRSB assumption hold; moreover, consider the single user system in Figure 3. Then, for j ∈ [1 : n], pjxˆ|x as deﬁned in (9) describes the conditional distribution of xˆ given x in Figure 3 where gmap[(·); λs, u] is a single user MAP estimator deﬁned

pzν |x,{zζ}νζ=−01 (zν |x, {zζ }ζν=−01) = Λν π(zν )

for ν ∈ [1 : b]. The factor Λν depends on x and {zζ}νζ=0, and the coefﬁcients λs and {λsν}bν=0 are coupled due to a set of ﬁxed point equations and bounded as b ↑ ∞.

Considering the bRSB ansatz, one concludes that the ansatz
extends the decoupled system in Figure 2 by approximating
the coupling interference with more taps. The approximation, however, stops to improve at some step b∗, if Λν = 1 for any integer ν > b∗. The extreme case is when for any ν ∈ [1 : b] in the bRSB ansatz Λν = 1. Here, the random variables {zν}bν=1 in Figure 3 become independent Gaussian, and therefore, the
decoupled system reduces to Figure 1. In fact in this case, the bRSB solution, as well as any νRSB ansatz with ν ∈ [1 : b],

reduces to the RS ansatz. Thus, one can consider the decoupled system under the RS ansatz to be a special case of the more general decoupled system given in Figure 3.
V. CONCLUSION
Decoupling seems to be a generic property of MAP estimators, as Proposition 1 justiﬁes it for any source distribution and a wide range of matrix ensembles. The validity of the result relies only on replica continuity; however, the equivalent single user system depends on the structure of the replica correlation matrix. Recent results in statistical mechanics have shown that failures in ﬁnding the exact solution via the replica method are mainly caused by the assumed structure, and not replica continuity. Inspired by the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses, for which the ∞RSB ansatz has been proved to be correct, one may consider Figure 3 to be the general decoupled system as b ↑ ∞. However, in many cases an accurate approximation might be provided by a ﬁnite number of RSB steps. An extreme case is the RS ansatz where all the interference terms in the RSB decoupled system become independent and Gaussian. Thus, one concludes that the previous results in the literature were both special and extreme cases of the RSB decoupled system. The RSB decoupled system raises several issues which require further investigations. For example, nothing is known about the distance between the conditional distributions of the interference terms and independent Gaussian distributions in probability space. The distance variation w.r.t. the number of interference taps can then describe the improvement caused by increasing the number of RSB steps.
