Stiff, elongated biomolecules such as ﬁlamentous viruses, DNA or cellulose nanocrystals are known to form liquid crystals often exhibiting a helical supramolecular organization. Little is known about the microscopic origin, size and handedness of the helical pitch in these, so-called cholesteric phases. Experimental observations in chiral lyotropics suggest that long-ranged chiral forces of electrostatic origin acting between the mesogens are responsible for such organization. Using large-scale computer simulation we study the sensitivity of the pitch imparted by soft microscopic helices and conﬁrm that the helical sense is sensitive to a change of packing fraction, magnitude of the molecular pitch and amplitude of the chiral interactions. In particular, we ﬁnd evidence that the cholesteric helix sense may change spontaneously upon variation of particle density, at ﬁxed molecular chirality. These pitch inversions have been reported in recent theoretical studies but simulation evidence remains elusive. We rationalize these sudden changes in the supramolecular helical symmetry on the basis of detailed measurements of the mean-torque generated by the twisting of the helices. The simulation methodology employed does not require conﬁning the twisted nematic in a slab geometry and allows for a simultaneous measurement of the pitch and the twist elastic constant. We ﬁnd that the twist elastic constant increases almost linearly with density suggesting that twisted nematic shows no signs of anomalous stiffening due to pre-smectic ﬂuctuations at higher packing fraction.

1 Introduction
Chirality is generally the absence of symmetry and plays a key role in the physics of liquid crystals 1. A molecule is termed chiral when, if reﬂected, any combination of rotational and translational operations fails to bring the molecule back to its original shape. A rigid linear achiral molecule is often represented by a uniaxial rod such as a hard spherocylinder. A system of many rods is a basic model for lyotropic liquid crystalline mesophases. The ﬁrst such phase is the nematic phase, where rods align along a similar direction given by the director vector n. Upon increasing the density, the nematic phase transforms into a lamellar structure consisting of layers of aligned rods with liquid-like intralayer structure called the smectic phase. The reﬂectional and uniaxial symmetry of the rods can be broken by the presence of interaction sites, representing speciﬁc chemical groups or charges residing on the particle surface, that render the intermolecular potential chiral. The chirality of the ‘patchy’ rod is referred to as microscopic and is generally weak compared to the achiral steric interactions between the rods which in turn stabilize nematic order. The microscopic chirality propagates throughout the underlying nematic causing a weak macroscopic twist 2. The result is a chiral nematic phase, also called cholesteric, possessing mesoscopic chirality characterized by a mesoscopic pitch, i.e. the distance at which the nematic director revolves by a full turn, and handedness indicating the direction of twist (left or right).

One of the most emblematic chiral shapes is the helix. Prominent examples can be found on the macromolecular scale such as the double-helix structure of DNA 3 and the alpha-helix secondary structure of proteins. Helical shapes may also arise due to spontaneous assembly of smaller chiral molecular units such as in the case of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) which adopt the shape of a twisted nanoribbon 4,5. These materials offer a promising route towards the fabrication of security papers or tunable mirrorless lasers 6,7. Helices are also abundant in the biological world; microtubules possess a helical internal structure 8, and the rigid spiral shape of bacterial ﬂagella can be exploited to study the effects of shape chirality on the structure and dynamics of dense ﬂuid phases 9.
While the helicity of macromolecules is generally ﬁxed by the molecular geometry of the atomic and molecular bonds, the origin of supramolecular helicity is often of a liquid crystalline nature 10. The mechanism underpinning the geometrical properties of the helical director ﬁeld and its handedness are, however, rather unclear even in simple systems and one may ask: “How does the helicity propagate from the macromolecular to the supramolecular scale?” and “What fundamental physical quantities control their left- or right-handed symmetry?
The nature of the helical twist of the director ﬁeld can be experimentally controlled by the properties of the macro-

1 INTRODUCTION

molecules as well as by certain thermodynamic properties such as temperature, particle density, or solvent conditions 11. There is a large body of experiments on cholesteric systems composed of chiral biomolecules revealing a particularly sensitive relationship between supramolecular helical order and external control parameters. For example, chinin suspensions extracted from crab exoskeletons form a cholesteric whose pitch is controlled by a subtle balance of the packing fraction and ionic strength 12. Microtubules in the cytoskeleton 3 are self-assembled from a collagen triple helix ﬁbers 13. Concentrated solutions of DNA 14,15 form both left- and right-handed cholesterics with different pitch versus temperature trends depending on the sequence of oligomers 16. Spontaneous helix inversions upon change of temperature were observed in thermotropic systems of polypeptides 17 and cellulose 18, and inversions upon changing the solvent conditions were reported for lyotropic systems poly-benzyl-L-glutamate 19 indicating that the nematic twist is governed by a subtle balance of forces whose exact origin remains partly obscure.
In this paper, we use large scale molecular dynamics simulations of a simple model system consisting of an achiral spherocylindrical backbone dressed with soft Yukawa patches forming a helical arrangement. Our particular focus is on ﬁnding evidence for so-called pitch inversions, where a sudden change of the cholesteric sense is produced upon a change of particle density at ﬁxed molecular pitch. These inversions have recently been conjectured from Onsager-type theories for chiral nematics of both soft 20 and hard helices 21 suggesting that these inversions are somehow inherent to a nematic organization of helical nanoparticles. These theories are, however, based on the second-virial approximation and do not capture particle correlations beyond mere pairs 22. Moreover they are mean-ﬁeld theories in which thermal ﬂuctuations of the particle density, orientations and ﬂuctuations in the (local) nematic director orientation are neglected. A careful molecular simulation study capable of accounting for these effects is therefore necessary and timely, in particular, in view of the subtle balance of torques that underpin these helical inversions.
Our inspiration for focussing on long-ranged chiral interactions stems from the observation of chiral nematic order in colloidal suspension of ﬁlamentous fd virus rods 23. Grelet and Fraden 24 have attempted to study the mechanism behind the twist by coating the fd virus with a thick layer of polymer in order to suppress the short-range chiral interactions and to treat the virus as a sterically stabilized colloid. The nematic phase, however, remains twisted and the pitch depends markedly on the salt concentration suggesting that the supramolecular twist must be due to weak but long-ranged electrostatic forces reaching beyond the distance shielded off by the polymer coating. A related study on another ﬁlamentous virus (M13) 25 argues that the observation of left-handed cholesteric phases formed by right-handed chiral viruses is

also due to a subtle competition between electrostatic interparticle forces. A similar conclusion is reached in the case of chiral phases of DNA 26,27.
Although the focus of this paper is on the competition between short-range steric and long-range chiral electrostatic repulsions it is worth mentioning the extensive body of work done on hard helices 28–31, where chirality is transmitted via steric interactions emerging from the helical shape 21,32–34. Following up on the early work of Straley 35 on hard threaded rods, density functional theory (DFT) was used to show that right-handed helices yield left-handed cholesterics at large microscopic pitch, and right-handed cholesterics if the microscopic pitch is small 21,32. This behavior is ascribed to small excluded-volumes differences between left- and right-handed twist on the pair level. Whilst the geometry of the hard helix is the main parameter deﬁning the sense of orientation, the degree of local alignment (as determined by the particle density) also plays a crucial role and may bring about pitch inversions at ﬁxed internal helicity 33. We reproduce these pitch inversions in our model for soft chirality and conﬁrm their robustness with respect to ﬂuctuations and multi-particle correlations that were hitherto neglected in these theoretical studies.
Particle-based simulation of chiral nematics is a non-trivial

2 SIMULATION MODEL

task and has been a long-standing challenge in computer modelling of liquid crystals 36,37. The ﬁrst complication is that the cholesteric pitch is usually much larger than the size of the simulation box. This requires simulating very large systems even though the computational burden can be alleviated somewhat using twisted boundary conditions, or by using a simulation box taking the shape of a hexagonal prism which accommodates for larger pitches 36. The second, more serious problem is that the two opposing planes perpendicular to the helix axis are periodic. This implies that, unless the system dimension along the helix axis exactly matches an integer times half the cholesteric pitch, the periodicity of the boundaries is incompatible with the natural helical order and a spurious torque is imparted onto the system. Two main workarounds have been developed to allow the pitch to be measured without the aforementioned bias. The ﬁrst is replacing the two sides perpendicular to the twist direction by two opposing hard walls, thus conﬁning the system to a slab geometry. This breaks the periodicity along the helix axis and lifts the undesired interactions introduced by the periodic boundary conditions 38–40. A disadvantage of this method is that the system loses its bulk properties near the boundaries due to the depletion forces exerted by the walls. The second approach, by contrast, takes advantage of the unphysical strain imparted by the periodicity and samples the average torque density the system experiences when the rods are constrained to adopt an unwisted (nematic) or a twisted conﬁguration (nematic director making a half turn across the box dimension) 41,42. Assuming the equilibrium twist to reside somewhere between the imposed untwisted and overtwisted one, one can compute the equilibrium pitch (and also the twist elastic constant) simultaneously via a simple interpolation procedure.
Most simulation studies of cholesterics reported so far rely on pairwise interactions which can be split into chiral and achiral parts. The intermolecular potential is usually based on some Gay-Berne 41,43 or hard-spherocylinder 38–40 reference potential supplemented with a simple pseudoscalar-type interaction potential encoding chirality. Alternatively, chirality can be introduced by the addition of chiral dopants 44 or induced by a chiral surface 45. The routinely used pseudoscalar potential is similar to the one proposed for soft helices 20 with the important difference that, in the latter, the molecular twist and handedness follow directly from the geometric features and interaction potential of the helices rather than having to be prescribed as input parameters. To our knowledge, the present paper provides the ﬁrst simulation study aimed at measuring helical pitches for a simple model of chiral patchy cylinders where the interactions can be split into a achiral and achiral part, and where the molecular pitch can be controlled explicitly by subtle changes in the spatial arrangement of the patches.

2 Simulation model

In our model, each molecule is composed of a hard rodlike backbone superimposed with a Yukawa helix 20,46, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The rod is modelled as a linear rigid body composed of 21 fused spheres, each interacting with the spheres from neighbouring rods via a Weeks-ChandlerAndersen potential

VWCA(r) =

4ε (σ /r)12 − (σ /r)6 + ε 0

r < 21/6σ , r ≥ 21/6σ ,

where r is the centre-of-mass distance between the spheres and σ is the approximate diameter of the repulsive core and ε is the interaction strength in units of the thermal energy kBT (in terms of Boltzmann’s constant kB and temperature T ). We take σ = 1.0, thus serving as our unit of length, and ﬁx ε = 1.0. The rod length is set at L = 10σ . The helix is discretized into np repulsive Yukawa patches with the potential
VY(r) = Ape−κr/r,
where κ = 2.0σ is the screening length. The potential is cut-off and shifted to zero at rc = 5σ . To ascertain that the total Yukawa repulsion between two molecules is constant and independent of the discretization of the spiral, the patch amplitude Ap is normalized by the number of patches via Ap = A/n2p. Unless otherwise stated, np = 5 for all systems simulated. The centres of the patches are located on the surface of the rod (distance σ /2 from the main axis) and its helical layout is described by a microscopic pitch p which can be right-handed or left-handed. For reasons of basic symmetry we only consider rods with a left-handed microscopic pitch.
To sample the statistics of the many-body system we use a dynamical integrator for rigid bodies 47,48, which has recently been implemented within the molecular simulator LAMMPS 49. The system is composed of N = 6534 rigid molecules in a canonical (NV T ) ensemble and periodic boundary conditions in all three Cartesian directions are applied. The simulation box is rectangular with dimensions Lz = 2Lx = 2Ly and volume V = LxLyLz. We deﬁne the packing fraction of the bare rods via φ = N(πσ 3/6 + πLσ 2/4)/V ignoring any contributions from the patches and assuming that the segmented rod can be mapped onto a hard spherocylinder 50. For simplicity the terms density and packing fraction both refer to φ . The time step in all simulations is ﬁxed at ∆t = 0.003.
As alluded to in the introduction, simulating a twisted nematic without bias from the periodic boundaries requires the macroscopic half pitch length to be exactly a multiple of the box dimension 36. Since we do not know the equilibrium pitch a priori an alternative strategy must be implemented. Here,

(a) A schematic illustration of the different length scales of the system; the microscopic pitch with magnitude p and the supramolecular, cholesteric pitch with length P. In this representation the main rod direction is identiﬁed with the local nematic director. The molecular pitches considered in this paper are of the scale of rod length p ∼ L, whereas the macroscopic pitches are much larger than the rod length (P L). (b) Snapshots of the untwisted and twisted states viewed from two different angles. The director in the twisted phase revolves by a half turn along the z-direction. The boundaries along the z-axis are fully periodic. The centers of Yukawa patches are indicated by small dark dots on the surface of the rods. The pitch of the twisted state has magnitude 2Lz and is signiﬁcantly smaller than the equilibrium pitch P, which typically ranges from 10Lz to 50Lz.
we follow the procedure of Allen and Masters 42 which consists of measuring the average torque density of an ensemble of rods adopting an artiﬁcial twist imposed by the periodic boundaries. As shown in Fig. 2, the system is simulated in two metastable states with macroscopic twist deﬁned by a wavenumber k = 0 (untwisted, nematic) and k = −π/Lz (half turn twist), with the latter corresponding to the left-handed macroscopic twist. Although compatibility with the periodic boundary condition along the z-direction is guaranteed in both cases, the systems are both metastable 41,42 because the imposed twist will be different from the equilibrium one.
The equilibrium pitch can be computed as follows. Let us denote the z-component of the torque vector between particle i and j as τizj. Similarly, we denote rizj as the z-component of the distance vector between the centre of particle i and j.

From this we deﬁne the tensor component

representing the torque per unit area. We denote the aver-
ages of Πzz as Πzz 0 for the untwisted sample and Πzz k for the half-turn twisted one with k = −π/Lz. The equilibrium macroscopic pitch can then be obtained from

The pitch P is right-handed if P > 0 and left-handed if P <

0. An important advantage of the method is that it allows for a simultaneous measurement of the twist elastic constant K2 which follows from

(2)

It turns out that, with the setup outlined in Fig. 2, the tensor

components Πzz can be measured without difﬁculty since the metastability of the untwisted and overtwisted states is sufﬁ-

ciently strong to guarantee good statistics.

All simulations are initiated from a cubic crystal composed

of molecules with random azimuthal angles and with their main axes aligned along the x direction. The untwisted ne-

matic is generated by melting the crystal during an equilibration run of 2 · 106 time steps. The twisted state is pre-

pared by imposing two hard walls at the top and bottom side

of the simulation box and by applying an external torque

onto the rods, consisting of two force ﬁelds of opposite sign

(force dipole), −F(z) and F(z), acting on either end seg-

ment of the spherocylinder. The direction of the force de-

scribes a half turn along the z axis and is parameterized by
F(z) = 100 · (cos(πz/L), sin(πz/L), 0) with 0 < z < Lz. A cubic crystalline starting conﬁguration is then allowed to relax during an equilibration run of 106 steps while the imposed ex-

ternal ﬁelds enforce the system to adopt the desired half-turn

twist with the local director residing in the xy-plane of the sim-

ulation box. The external torque ﬁeld and the conﬁning walls

are subsequently removed, and the system is equilibrated for another 2 · 106 steps while remaining in the twisted state. The length of the production run is 5 · 106 steps with averages of Πzz calculated every 5 · 103 steps. The simulation runs at a speed of 106 steps which takes about 15 hours on 4 proces-

sors. The chosen system size is sufﬁciently large to ensure

that ﬁnite size effects are negligible in our analysis.

is stable against smectic order at large packing fraction, and against isotropic order at low density. An additional requirement is that the density must be high enough to keep the constrained twisted nematic stable during the production run. We ﬁnd that this stability is no longer guaranteed at densities close to the nematic-isotropic transition. In what follows, we brieﬂy discuss the choice of parameters, in particular the rod geometry and its effect on the phase behavior.
If the rod aspect ratio is small the density region over which the nematic is stable is narrow 50, and the metastability of the twisted nematic is too weak. If the rods are too long, the simulations become computationally expensive because larg systems with large nearest neighbor cells need to be considered. We ﬁnd that L = 10σ provides the optimal aspect ratio. In view of the conditions above, we consider packing fractions in the range 0.34 ≤ φ < 0.43. The upper bound of this interval is the nematic-smectic transition density of the achiral patchless rods, which is in a very good agreement with earlier predictions for hard spherocylinders 50. The lower bound is a safe estimate of the lowest density at which the imposed twisted nematic can be kept stable during the course of the simulation run.
As for the phase stability of the nematic, the addition of repulsive patches to the spherocylindrical backbone produces two distinct effects. First, the effective aspect ratio is reduced. The phase diagram of hard spherocylinders 50–52 then implies that the interval of the nematic stability should become narrower and shift to higher packing fractions. Second, the patches increase the effective density of the system. We ﬁnd that the increased density has a more pronounced impact on the phase boundaries than the reduction of the aspect ratio. The net implication is that both the isotropic-nematic and nematic-smectic transition densities shift to smaller packing fractions φ when the amplitude A grows larger. We found that the phase boundaries are also affected by changes in the microscopic pitch. For example, a nematic system with A = 1000, np = 5 and φ = 0.37 crosses over into a smectic for large microscopic pitches p > 15. We stress that all results shown in this paper are in the stable nematic range. Data points corresponding to systems that are believed to be affected by long-lived smectic ﬂuctuations are indicated by open symbols in all ﬁgures.
We ﬁnally mention that kinetically arrested structures such as a Wigner glass 53,54 may occur in systems with long range interactions. To ensure that we steer clear of dynamically arrested states, we monitor the diffusive properties of the particles at the densest phases simulated. The translational diffusion constant is deﬁned as D = limt→∞ r2(t) /6t, where r2(t) is the mean square displacement. The smallest diffusion constant we measure is D = 5 · 10−5 for a system with Ap = 20 and φ = 0.42. This implies that during the production run, a rod traverses an average distance of 25D = 2.5L and that

The two-patch rod model (np = 2) is non-chiral and produces a large pitch 843L resembling an untwisted nematic. All systems have a packing fraction φ = 0.35, amplitude A = 1000, and microscopic pitch p = 1.25L. The solid line is drawn to guide the eye.

there are no signs of dynamic arrest.

3.2 Pitch versus density: spontaneous sense inversion

Let us ﬁrst address the sensitivity of the pitch on the discretization of the Yukawa spiral. The results in Fig. 3 show that the use of 5 patches constitutes a good approximation of a continuous spiral 20, in which case the number of patches would be inﬁnite. We ﬁnd that using a larger number of patches puts a considerable burden on the simulation time, due to the longrange interactions, with only limited extra accuracy.
Next, we scrutinize the effect of particle density. The results in Fig. 4 exhibit a common trend where the cholesteric pitch decreases systematically with concentration. The scaling of the pitch with density around the isotropic-nematic transition density φ0 reveals a simple power law

P ∝ (φ − φ0)α ,

(3)

with exponent α ≈ −1 in quantitative accord with theoretical predictions 55,56 and in qualitative agreement with experimental results on fd virus suspensions at reduced salt concentration 24 .
Examples of spontaneous inversions of the macroscopic helical symmetry can be gleaned from Fig. 5, Here, the direction of twist suddenly changes from left to right upon variation of the density. Comparing the low density regions of Figs. 5 and 4 reveals that the twist is systematically negative for the weaker amplitude, and positive for the stronger amplitude. The effect of the amplitude on the helical symmetry is further examined in Fig. 6(a). It is very plausible that the

Fig. 5 Cholesteric pitch inversion as a function of the packing fraction for chiral amplitude Ap = 10 and two different values of microscopic pitch p. Below are the typical snapshots of the system at different densities and p = 1.2L. The last snapshot exhibits a slow
onset of smectic ﬂuctuations. Drawn lines are curves ﬁtted on the form P = P0(φ − φ ∗)−1 with offset P0 and inversion density φ ∗.

helical inversion with amplitude originates from packing effects as well (cf. Fig. 5) given the enhanced effective system density at increasing amplitude.
The density at which the inversion occurs can be lowered by a slight reduction of the microscopic pitch as is evident from Fig. 5. This observation tallies with predictions from DFT 20 where the critical degree of local alignment (proportional to rod density) at which the inversion takes place drops upon decreasing the molecular pitch. A remarkable feature is that the magnitude of the macroscopic pitch P should strictly diverge at the inversion point where the cholesteric should unwind completely and form a nematic phase even though the rods are distinctly chiral. None of the systems with a density close to the inversion point are affected by ﬂuctuations pertaining to smectic layering as can be seen from the snapshots attached. There is no sign of an anomalous increase of the twist elastic resistance near the critical density as will be demonstrated in the next paragraph.
The handedness of the macroscopic pitch P can also be changed by modifying the microscopic pitch p. The direct correlation between the microscopic and macroscopic pitch is highlighted in Fig. 6(b) and conﬁrms the interrelationship to be highly non-trivial. More importantly, it illustrates the possibility of cholesteric helix inversions induced by changes in

the molecular conformation affecting the internal helicity of the constituents. These conformational modiﬁcations may, in turn, be governed by changes in temperature in case of thermotropic assemblies.
Some insight into the microscopic origin of the pitch inversion can be gathered from analysing the torque per unit area in the untwisted phase. Equation (1) implies that an inversion (|P| → ∞) occurs when the net twist propensity vanishes, i.e., Πzz 0 → 0. Assuming a pairwise additive interaction, we can split the torque into a chiral part corresponding to the Yukawa patches and a nonchiral part representing the backbone segments, Πzz 0 = Πazz 0 + Πczz 0. A pitch inversion can then be identiﬁed with a balance of mean torque densities: Πazz 0 = − Πczz 0. The results in Figures 7(a) and (b) show that Πazz 0 remains negative throughout the density interval while Πczz 0, changes sign going from small to large density. The rapid upswing from negative to positive observed in the chiral contribution Πczz 0 outweighs the negative contribution of the achiral torque Πazz 0 and causes the cholesteric to twist from left- to right-handed. From this we can conclude that the sense inversion is entirely driven by the chiral part of rod potential. Moreover, the intermolecular torque generated by the helical patches may either have a positive or negative signature

Close inspection of Fig. 7(b) reveals that Πczz 0 has a local minimum just before the onset of the fast growth, where the linear ﬁt yields a negative gradient at low densities and positive gradient at high densities. This suggests the existence of an optimum density in the transition region where the negative twist is maximal and hints at a sudden emergence of a positive torque contribution at a critical density.
In case of a scenario with no pitch inversion (Fig. 4), the contribution of the chiral part Πczz 0 is strictly positive (results are not shown) and their values are signiﬁcantly larger than the contributions of the achiral part Πazz 0, which are systematically negative. Therefore, in this situation the orientation of the macroscopic pitch remains right-handed throughout the nematic density range.

of Πzz k and Πzz 0. The error bars for Ap > 0 are not displayed but are of comparable magnitude.

3.3 Twist elastic constant versus packing fraction
It is worthwhile to brieﬂy embark on a detailed analysis of the twist elastic constants K2 emerging from our simulation data. This is particularly so in view of the complications encountered in measuring the elastic properties of liquid crystals in simulation 36,58,59 and because of their importance in the interpretation of experimental results 10. In fact, as far as we are aware, no simulation results have been published as yet showing how the twist elasticity of spherocylinder nematics behaves with density. Similar to the pitch, the elastic constant can be readily obtained from the torque density contributions according to Eq. (2). The results for the bare spherocylinders are shown in Fig. 8 and compared with predictions from fundamental measure density functional theory 57. It is striking to observe that K2 seems to grow linearly with density without showing any sign of divergence close to the nematic-smectic transition as has been often conjectured in view of the generic incompatibility between lamellar order and twist 60,61. Our results, however, suggest that the slow growth with density extends smoothly to regions where smectic ﬂuctuations become predominant. A similar trend is observed for the patchy rods; although the amplitude of K2 is enhanced upon increasing the amplitude of the Yukawa patches, its (near-)linear density dependence is preserved. We stress that in view of the large errors incurred and because of ﬁnite size effects that may play

a role at larger packing fractions where smectic ﬂuctuations prevail the results in Fig. 8 can only provide a qualitative, yet valuable guideline.
3.4 Pitch measurement in slab geometry
In addition to the torque-based technique we have also attempted to determine the macroscopic pitch using Monte Carlo simulations of a similar model (hard spherocylinders plus helical Yukawa patches) in which the rods are conﬁned between two hard walls 38,40. The walls enforce the nematic to align along the xy-plane and at the same time break the periodicity along the z-axis, thus ensuring that particle orientations are not coupled through the boundaries imposed along the twist direction. The macroscopic pitch can then be estimated from the twist of the local nematic director n(z) by sampling bulk statistics far from the boundaries. However, in our simulations, we observe large ﬂuctuations in the density close to the walls, which point to the formation of a smectic wetting layer. These smectic layers show signs of dynamic arrest and misalignment across the periodic boundaries in the xy-plane. As a consequence, they impart a strong spurious twist onto the system and suppress the natural weak twist favored by the Yukawa spirals. Even though the effect of the hard walls is negligible around the center of the simulation box, where bulk behavior should be recovered, we believe that the presence of these long-lived smectic ﬂuctuations undermines the suitability of the hard-wall method for measuring macroscopic pitches in a bias-free manner, at least for the model system and concentration ranges investigated here.
4 Conclusions
We have presented large-scale simulations of cholesteric phases of helical patchy rods and provide evidence of a delicate relation between chirality on the molecular scale and the macroscopic scale. In particular, we have established that the magnitude and handedness of the cholesteric pitch can be carefully tuned by the packing fraction of the system, by the magnitude and sign of the microscopic pitch and that it shows a marked sensitivity with respect to the strength of the chiral interactions. While left-handed helical rods twist into lefthanded cholesterics at low packing fractions (or at weak chiral interactions) they form right-handed cholesterics at higher packing fractions (or at strong chiral interactions).
We show that the density at which the pitch inversion occurs depends the microscopic pitch; the observed trend is in line with recent theoretical predictions for soft helices. In the absence of pitch inversion, the pitch can be described by a simple algebraic density scaling P ∝ φ −1, in good agreement with experimental observations in chiral nematics of ﬁlamentous virus particles and theoretical predictions. Irrespective of

the patchyness of the rods, we ﬁnd that the twist elastic constant of a nematic phase of repulsive spherocylinders grows linearly with packing fraction even in the proximity of the nematic-smectic transition, contrary to common belief where an anomalous growth or divergence is expected close to the transition 10.
Future efforts could be aimed at a careful measurement of orientational pair-correlation functions and effective pairtwisting potentials with the aim to investigate whether the mechanism behind the cholesteric sense inversion reported in our simulation can somehow be connected to an effective double-minimum twisting potential such as found for soft helices; the minima are located at opposite signs of the intermolecular angle and suggest that i) helices with a certain molecular pitch have the propensity to twist in both directions and ii) the preferred twist direction is dictated by the amount of local orientational freedom the helices experience 20. The data for the effective multi-particle torque density of the helices reported here point to a mechanism very similar to the one put forward in the theory. Above all, our simulation results clearly demonstrate the robustness of these chirality inversions in twisted nematics of helical mesogens. They are not artefacts of the second-virial (and other approximations) inherent to the theory. Nor are they suppressed by ﬂuctuations in the director ﬁeld or by density ﬂuctuations generating local smectic order.
On a more ambitious level, it would be intriguing to investigate to what extent kinetic factors contribute to the handedness of the macroscopic pitch. Recent simulation studies show that the chirality of ﬁbrillar aggregates not only depends on the chirality of the constituent ﬁbres but also on the kinetic pathway of the self-assembly process 62. A temporal change, for instance, in the local ionic strength may affect the binding sites between the ﬁlaments, thereby changing the molecular helicity which, in turn, may lead to chirality inversion on the ﬁbre scale 63.
Short-fragment DNA strands may polymerize into longer units which subsequently self-organize into cholesteric phases. Recent attempts have been made 64 to model these systems from a theoretical (DFT) perspective, focussing solely on shape chirality. The challenge here would be to include electrostatic chirality (on a coarse-grained level as done here) and see how both effects combined inﬂuence the pitch sensitivity and, indeed, the stability of the cholesteric state itself. In case of pronounced shape chirality, other chiral nematic phases different from the cholesteric may prevail and pair correlation functions measuring correlations between e.g. the azimuthal helix orientations could shed light on the stability of so-called twist-bend 65,66 or screw-like nematics 29 which may emerge in these systems. Last but not least, particle ﬂexibility is believed to play an important role in the cholesteric self-organization of DNA and fd virus rods but its precise implications remain ob-
