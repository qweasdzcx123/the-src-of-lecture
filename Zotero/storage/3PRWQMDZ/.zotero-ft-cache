Deep neural networks are susceptible to \emph{adversarial} attacks. [ ... ] Key Result We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the ImageNet model.
